  <h2 class='c008'><span class="bl">Introductory Note.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c009'>THIS historical sketch of the Skinners’
Company of London, to which I was
apprenticed some forty years ago, and
which I have since had the exceptional honour
of serving through seven Wardenships and two
Masterships (1886–7 and 1894–5) is an expansion
of a Paper read before Ye Sette of
Odd Volumes at Limmer’s Hotel, on the 25th
November, 1902.</p>

<p class='c010'>Who that reads can feel surprise that such a
Company, with such a past—and such a present—commands
and receives the loyal and enthusiastic
devotion of all its members.</p>

<p class='c010'>Five-and-twenty years ago disparaging criticisms
of the ancient Livery Companies of the
City of London were not uncommon. It had
become a habit with writers of a certain class
to describe the members of the Companies as
illiterate people battening on public money,
employing themselves in what was often spoken
of as “gorging and guzzling” at the expense of
their trusts, incapable of sitting down to a meal
without the incentive of £5 notes secreted
under their plates; and whose business, when
any was done, largely consisted in granting
beneficial leases of their trust estates to one
another. All ignorant and malignant fiction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whether anyone ever believed these stories
it is difficult to say. At the present time, at all
events, there can be few, if any, who can continue
to do so. In point of fact, the members
of the Companies are very much like other
people, educated in the same ways, and actuated
by the same motives, but with a strong
sense of their responsibility for the maintenance
by their Companies of the high position which
they gained, centuries gone by. The funds of
which the Companies dispose are either their
trust funds—as to the dealings with which the
Charity Commissioners can speak—or their corporate
funds, which are governed by their own
pleasure. No £5 notes are hidden under
plates; no beneficial leases of a Company’s
property are granted to its members. The
employment of a member of the Court of the
Skinners’ Company to work for the Company
for remuneration, whether professionally, commercially,
or otherwise, is strictly prohibited. It
is no doubt true that portions of the Companies’
own incomes are spent on entertainments, in
accordance with the practice which has prevailed
ever since the Companies existed at all;
but I do not think that here, at all events, or in
any other place where good fellowship prevails,
any complaint will be made of this. Moreover,
as the money spent is the Companies’ own,
criticism would appear to be irrelevant. The
entire income of the Companies, after payment
of their expenses, including the cost of the
entertainments, &amp;c., is allocated to objects of
public utility, selected by the owners.</p>

<p class='c010'>The former misconceived attacks were very
wounding to the members of the Companies,
whose feelings of personal honour and of
affection towards their Company were sorely
outraged by them. For my own part, when I
compare my Company, my School, my University,
my College, my Inn of Court, I doubt
whether any but William of Wykeham’s Winchester
can vie with the Skinners’ Company in
my affections.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are several reasons for this which
appear to me to be good. One is, that a member
of such a Company feels himself to be
connected by a direct link with the History of
England, of which these Companies are part.
Their destinies have been shaped and guided
by men, of whom many have done good service
to their country, and who stand towards their
successors of later date in the position of
honoured and revered ancestors, to be followed
and imitated so far as change of circumstances
permits. They are gone, but their work remains
to be preserved and extended.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another reason is the opportunity which
membership of a Company affords of being of
some little use in one’s own day and generation.
There is great scope for this in the wise and
prudent management of the affairs of a great
Company. The sick have to be tended, the
poor to be relieved, the schools to be governed,
the exhibitions and prizes to be awarded, the
estates to be managed, worthy institutions to be
selected for support, all the multifarious matters
connected with the ownership of property and
the dispensation of charity to be controlled.
All these must be of interest to any generous
mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then there is the association with agreeable
and congenial comrades. Both Oxford and
Cambridge are well represented in the Court of
the Skinners’ Company, and few of the greater
public schools lack at least one supporter.
Eton, Winchester, Westminster, Harrow, Rugby,
Charterhouse, Marlborough, Clifton, Tonbridge,
King’s College School, are all to be found there.
Other members have been claimed by Commerce
at an early age, but all are cultivated and
kindhearted, and united in the desire to promote
the benefit of the Company and the useful and
just disposal of its resources. A pleasanter or
more congenial society could not easily be
found. It has been a source of much gratification
to me that I was allowed to assume
the title of “Skynner” to ye Sette.</p>

<p class='c010'>The narrative which follows can be filled in
by reference to the “Account of the Worshipful
Company of Skinners of London,” which was
published by my regretted friend and colleague,
the late James Foster Wadmore, A.R.I.B.A.,
while this Paper was in course of preparation.
He had then recently completed fifty years of
service in the Court of the Company, of which
he was for several years the senior member, but
survived the publication only a few months.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><span class="bl">An Old City Company.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c009'>THE corporate name of the Company is
“The Master and Wardens of the
Guild or Fraternity of the Body of
Christ of the Skinners of London.” The
association with the feast of Corpus Christi,
held on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday,
goes back to the earliest days of the Company,
and the annual Corpus Christi procession and
feast of the Company are referred to and expressly
sanctioned by the Charter of 1392—16
Ric. II. When the name is Latinized, the
word “Pelliparii” serves as the equivalent of
Skinners.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Arms of the Company date from 4 Edw.
VI., and are as follows:—The Shield—<i>Ermine</i>,
on a chief <i>gules</i>, three ducal coronets <i>or</i>, capped
of the field and tasselled gold. The Crest—a
lizard (Lynx) statant proper, gorged with a
wreath, leaved <i>vert</i>, purffled <i>or</i>. The Supporters—Dexter,
a lizard proper; Sinister, a martin
<i>sable</i>; each gorged with a wreath, leaved <i>vert</i>.
Motto—“To God only be all Glory.” Down
to the seventeenth century “In Christo Fratres”
was used.</p>

<p class='c010'>The date of the first establishment of this
Company is unknown, but it was certainly long
prior to the year 1327—1 Edw. III—when the
first Royal Charter was granted to “Our beloved
men of the City of London called Skynners.”
Later charters were granted from time to time,
but it is not necessary to refer to them here.
The Company also holds an unlimited license
in mortmain. The earlier of the City Companies,
such as the Weavers, Saddlers, and
others, claim to have had their beginning in
Saxon times. Whether the same is true of the
Skinners, it is now impossible to say, but at all
events the grant of the charter constituted a
Royal recognition of what was already a voluntarily
existing fraternity.</p>

<p class='c010'>An old book in the possession of the Company,
written on vellum and illuminated, which
dates from the end of the fifteenth century,
contains a list of names of the “Founders and
Bretherne and Susterne of the fraternity of
Corpus Christi founded by the Worshipful
Fellowship of Skynners of the Citee of London,
that is to wit.”—</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>And others of less distinction, several of whom
are described as “clerk,” nearly 600 in all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then follows a list of names of sisters of the
fraternity, rather more than 100 in all. The
membership of the Skinners’ Company is still
open to females, but only through patrimony;
and as a female member can only become a freewoman,
and is not eligible for the Livery, only
few take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p class='c010'>So far as the records of the Company show,
there is no evidence to support the idea that
membership of the Company was ever confined
to skinners or furriers. A list of 1446 contains
the names of persons variously described as
“doctour,” “bocher,” “dier,” “joyner,” “groser,”
“skynner,” and so on. So again, in a list of
members admitted to the Livery in 1738, there
were only six skinners out of twenty-seven, the
remainder of whom are described as engaged in
other occupations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The working or “Artesan” Skinners, however,
made attempts on various occasions to obtain
admission as such into the governing body of
the Company, but such attempts invariably
proved unsuccessful. In 1606, the “Artesan”
Skinners applied for and obtained the grant of a
new charter to the Company, providing for the
election of a certain proportion of working
skinners, and the admission to the Court of
certain persons named; but the Company brought
the matter before the Privy Council, and they
after report made by the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen, ordered the improperly-obtained
charter to be cancelled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again, in 1744, the “Artesan” Skinners proceeded
in the Court of King’s Bench for a mandamus,
to compel the Court to choose certain of
the “Artesans” as members of the Court, but
such proceedings failed. In 1747–8, a similar
further attempt was made without success; and
since then the Company has had no further
annoyance of this description.</p>

<p class='c010'>The constitution and government of the
Company are as follows:—At the head comes
the Court, consisting of the Master, four
Wardens (known respectively as First or Upper
Warden, Second Warden, Third Warden, and
Renter Warden, of whom the Renter Warden,
though possessing the privileges of a member
of the Court, is not one technically until elected
to membership at the end of his year of office),
and Assistants, all of whom but one (the last-preceding
Renter Warden) are usually Past-Masters.
The above form the governing body
of the Company. The total number of the
Court is fixed at not exceeding thirty. At one
time the Assistants were termed the XVI., and
apparently did not exceed that number. The
members of the Court are all members of the
Livery, and next to them come the other members
of the Livery, who are without seats in
the governing body. Below them come the
Freemen, and after them the Apprentices.</p>

<p class='c010'>To trace the career of a member up to the
Chair—if he is not the son of a freeman, born
after the date of his father’s freedom, so as himself
to be entitled to the freedom by patrimony,
he must be apprenticed to a freeman while
between the ages of 14 and 21. After seven
years of apprenticeship he is entitled to the
freedom, and it is usual to take up the freedom
of the City of London at the same time as the
freedom of the Company. Those entitled by
patrimony are able to take up the freedom on
attaining 21. The Livery are elected by the
Court from the freemen. The practice has
fluctuated. Sometimes the Court have elected
practically all qualified candidates free from
objection. At other times, when the numbers
appeared to be growing too fast, limits have
been imposed. At the present time, the rule
is to restrict the number of Liverymen elected
after apprenticeship to not exceeding three a
year. This is in addition to patrimonial candidates.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the Livery one is chosen annually by
the Court, on Corpus Christi Day, to serve as
Renter Warden for the year ensuing. The
Renter Warden was in former years the Bursar
of the Company. He received the rents and
made the payments. He had the charge of the
moveable property of the Company, and was
responsible for all. In return for this, certain
of the Company’s benefactors directed small
annual payments to the Renter Warden. The
Renter Warden still checks over the plate of
the Company on taking office, but his responsible
duties are now discharged by the salaried
officers of the Company, under the directions of
the Court and its committees. At the end of
the Skinners’ year, <i>i.e.</i>, on the following Corpus
Christi Day, it is usual for the retiring Renter
Warden to be elected to the Court, and through
the following year he acts as junior member,
without office. The following year he is elected
third Warden, the next second Warden, the
next first Warden, and then Master; so that in
six years from his election as Renter Warden he
has passed the Chair, and goes to the bottom of
the Assistants, with only his own ex-Renter
Warden below him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ancient officers of the Company are the
Clerk and the two Beadles, the Clerk being the
trusted and chief executive official, while the
Beadles discharge duties of a humbler character.
To these have been added, in more recent
times, the Solicitor, the Surveyor, and the
Accountant.</p>

<p class='c010'>On Corpus Christi Day the Election Court is
held at noon, the members being arranged round
the horseshoe table in their usual order: that is
to say, the Master in the Chair at the head of
the table, with the Clerk at his right hand.
Beyond him, the four Wardens in order of
precedence. The Master and Wardens alone
wear their gowns at this and all other meetings
of the Court. On the Master’s left hand the
Senior Assistant sits, and beyond him, and
round the outside and inside of both branches of
the table, come the remaining Assistants, more
or less in order of seniority, though this is not
strictly adhered to. After the Minutes of the
previous meeting have been read, the first
Warden is nominated for the Mastership by a
member, and leaves the room. Another member
is nominated in competition with him, and
after the first Warden has been elected on a
show of hands, he is called back into the Court-Room,
and returns his thanks. The same
course is adopted with the retiring second and
third Wardens and the Renter Warden of the
year before, who are respectively elected first,
second, and third Wardens. Then follows the
election of most interest—that of the new
Renter Warden, who is to join the Court for
the first time. Subject to the rule incapacitating
more than two near relatives from membership
at the same time, any member of the livery
is eligible after the completion of seven years of
membership, and of these some will have been
nominated by various members of the Court in
the previous March. The selection between these
is made by ballot, the name or names having the
fewest votes being removed from the list at
each round, so that the final result represents
the general sense of the Court as nearly as
possible. After this, it is usual for the retiring
Renter Warden to be elected to the Court.
The various committees are then appointed,
and the annual re-election of Officers follows.
Shortly after 2 p.m., the Court, and such of
the livery as are able to attend, preceded by
the Beadles with their staves, and by the Clerk,
and accompanied by the Preacher, proceed
through the streets to the Church of St. Mary,
Aldermary (since the demolition of St. Antholin’s),
where a service is performed and the
annual sermon delivered by the Preacher, who
is selected by the Master, and is usually a
highly-placed ecclesiastic, sometimes of episcopal—or
even archiepiscopal—rank.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the evening the traditional election banquet
takes place in the Company’s Hall, in
Dowgate Hill. The Master has on his right the
four outgoing Wardens, in order of precedence,
and next to them the third and Renter Wardens
elect. On his left are the Guests of the Company,
and the remaining seats are occupied by
the Court and Livery, all of whom are invited.
When dinner is over, and the loyal toasts have
been honoured, the doors of the hall are thrown
open to the strains of music, and a procession
enters, headed by the musicians, who are followed
by ten Christ’s Hospital boys, representing
the ten scholars formerly nominated by the
Company under the will of Mr. Stoddard (1611).
Then come ten of the junior Liverymen, each
carrying alternately one of the five Cokayne
cups, referred to later on, or one of the election
caps, and after them the two Beadles with their
staves, and the Clerk. The procession marches
round the hall from left to right, and halts
when the first of the Liverymen comes opposite
the Master for the second time. The Master
then takes from him the first cap and, after
trying it vainly on the heads of some of the
chief Guests, fits it successfully on the Master-elect,
to whom he then drinks from the first
of the five cups. Then the music strikes up,
and the procession moves round the hall again,
till a circuit has been completed, when another
halt is called, and the first, second, and third
Wardens elect are successively capped and
pledged. Then follows another circuit of the
procession, and a similar recognition of the
Renter-elect, after which the procession resumes
its march, and leaves the hall. As each
of the five Elect is capped, he returns to his
seat, wearing the cap, the retiring Renter Warden
making way for the third and Renter Wardens
elect to pass above him. After an interval, the
caps are laid aside, and the Master proceeds to
propose the health of the Master-elect, and
after his response the ordinary proceedings
are resumed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Cokayne cups bear the date-mark of
1565, and passed to the Company under the
will, dated 1598, of Mr. William Cokayne.
Each stands 16½ in. high, and is in the form of
a silver-gilt cock standing on a tortoise, the
head of the cock being removable. Ever since
the cups came into the possession of the Company
they have been used at the election
banquet, in pursuance of an engagement entered
into by the Company at the time of the bequest
becoming operative. Their value must be very
great. The workmanship is somewhat delicate,
and repairs have had to be executed from time
to time. Thus, Renter Warden’s account,
1661–2:—</p>

<p class='c012'>“Paid Jacob Boddendicke for makeing a new tayle for
one of the cockes and refreshing 3 other cockes
and mending their tayles and one of the cases—005–10–00.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The actual change of office does not take
place until the Swearing-in Court, held on the
Thursday following Corpus Christi. At that
Court the outgoing Master takes the Chair,
having a second similar Chair on his left hand,
and the outgoing Wardens in their usual places
on his right. After the Minutes of the Election
Court have been read, the new Master makes
his declaration, and takes the Chair, the ex-Master
moving into the vacant Chair placed for
him. Then the Senior Past-Master heads a
procession round the Court-Room, the other
members falling into their places as the procession
moves on, the Wardens coming last,
and so they file past the two Chairs, offering
congratulations to the new Master, and condolences
to his predecessor. Then the three
senior Wardens elect make their declarations
simultaneously, and proceed past the Master,
ex-Master, and Senior Member, and round the
room, to receive the felicitations of their colleagues.
Then the new Renter Warden is
called into the room, and goes through the
same process. As the Master and Wardens
make their declarations, to which all the members
present listen standing, they assume their
gowns, which, as already stated, they alone wear
habitually throughout the sittings of the Court,
though not in Committees. Then the ex-Renter
Warden makes his declaration as a
Member of the Court. The two Beadles are
present. Then follows the reading of a selection
from the Ordinances of the Company, after
which a vote of thanks to the ex-Master for his
“prudent government of the Company during
the past year” is proposed, carried, and responded
to, and the proceedings then follow a
normal course. At the banquet in the evening
the new Master is in the Chair, having the
ex-Master in a similar Chair at his left hand.
The latter’s health is proposed in the course of
the evening, after which his retirement is complete.
At this banquet the Master and Wardens
wear their badges for the first time, of which
the Master’s badge was provided by the
Company in 1874–5, and the Wardens’ badges
have been presented since by various Past-Masters.</p>

<p class='c010'>The “othe of the newe maister and wardeyns
the morowe after the day of corporis
X’pi,” as taken in the fifteenth century, is worthy
of note. “Ye shall swere that ye shalbe true
liegemen unto oure liege lorde the Kyng, and
to his heyres Kyngs; ye shall be indifferent
jugis betwene party and party, withoute favoure,
love, or affeccion, and withoute malice or any
evill will to any parsone or parsons: all maner
ordenances and good rules that bene made or
shall be made for the wele of this craft of
Skynners ye shall truly execute and kepe; ye
shall not breke any of the ordenances made by
ye comyn assente and hole agreement of all the
XVI of thys Companye w<sup>t</sup>oute ye hoole agrement
of alle or of ye most part of ye same XVI.
All these thyngs ye shall truly observe and
kepe; so help you God and all seyntes, and by
the boke; and kys ye hyt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old custom was that the Lord Mayor of
London acted as Chief Butler at the Coronation
of a Sovereign, assisted by a representative of
each of the twelve great Companies. John
Pasmer, Pellipar, represented the Skinners’
Company in this way at the Coronation of
Richard III, in 1483; and so recently as the
Coronation of George IV, in 1821, the Company
was similarly represented by Mr. Thomas Moore,
who was Master of the Company at the time of
that King’s accession to the throne.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Company has in its possession a complete
list of the Masters from 1485 downwards.
A few only of the earlier Masters can be identified.
Thus, John Penne is described as
Master of the Company in 1409 in a deed of
that year, and William Newenham as Master in
1434 in a will of that date.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it
seems to have been customary for the same
member to occupy the Chair on several occasions,
especially when he was conspicuous among
the Aldermen of the City of London. Thus,
between the years 1485 and 1600 only thirty-nine
members served the office, of whom the
most frequent occupants of the Chair were:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir William Martyn, 5 times, the first being in 1485,
and the last in 1502.</p>
<p class='c013'>Sir Thomas Mirfine, 5 times, the first being in 1509,
and the last in 1516.</p>
<p class='c013'>Geoffrey Walkeden, 5 times, the first being in 1561,
and the last in 1577.</p>
<p class='c013'>Sir John Champneys, 6 times, the first being in 1527,
and the last in 1539.</p>
<p class='c013'>Sir Andrew Judd, 6 times, the first being in 1533,
and the last in 1555.</p>
<p class='c013'>Sir Wolstan Dixie, 7 times, the first being in 1573,
and the last in 1592.</p>
<p class='c013'>Alderman Philip Gunter, 8 times, the first being in
1556, and the last in 1582.</p>

<p class='c010'>Seven others served for four years each within
the same period.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the sixteenth century the practice of
re-election became nearly obsolete, and at the
present day it is never adopted except in the
case of the death or retirement of the Master,
or one of the five members in the succession to
the Chair, in which event a Past-Master has to
be elected in order to avoid dislocating the
ordinary course of the Company. Only eight
re-elections took place during the whole of the
nineteenth century; and there are at the present
time only two double Past-Masters in existence.
On leaving the Chair for the second time, a
double Past-Master regains his original precedence.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the seventeenth century, three instances
occurred of noblemen who had joined the
Company being elected and serving as Master.
These were the Earl of Berkeley in 1685, the
Earl of Monmouth (afterwards of Peterborough)
in 1690, and the Earl of Romney in 1696. At
the Election Court at the conclusion of the
Earl of Monmouth’s Mastership (June 18th,
1691), it is recorded in the Minutes that “Ye
R<sup>t</sup> Hon<sup>ble</sup> ye Master appeared and tooke his
place;” and after the elections were over
it was ordered that a dinner should be given,
on which £60 should be expended, “To w<sup>ch</sup>
the R<sup>t</sup> Hon<sup>ble</sup> the Master declared hee would
make the same up 100<i>l.</i> But the Co<sup>rt</sup> considering
his Lo<sup>pps</sup> extraordinary bounty from time to
time shewed to ye Company, w<sup>th</sup> great importunity
prayed his Lo<sup>pps</sup> excuse therein, letting
his Hono<sup>r</sup> know a Buck was ye usuall and only
p<sup>r</sup>sent made by ye Mast<sup>r</sup> on ye like occasion.
Upon mo’con to know who should preach ye
Elec’con Sermon, it was by the R<sup>t</sup> Hon<sup>ble</sup> ye
Mas<sup>tr</sup> declared that he would appoint his owne
Chaplaine to performe ye same.” In recent
years it has become usual for each Master to
leave with the Company some permanent record
of his year of office, in the form of a piece of
plate, but this is a purely voluntary act.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is usual for the Master to officiate at public
ceremonials—such as laying of foundation-stones,
opening of new buildings, and the like,
instead of inviting distinguished aliens to act;
and a collection of the records of some of such
occasions will be found in Appendix III.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is also usual, in the event of a child being
born to the Master during his year of office, for
the four Wardens to stand godfathers to the
child on behalf of the Company, and for a
silver cradle or its equivalent to be presented
by the Company to their godchild. It is an
understood thing that the child, if a boy, shall
be christened “Skinner,” and, if a girl, shall be
christened “Pellipar,” or some variant of that
name. Such occasions have of late years been
far from frequent. In fact, there has been only
one within the last quarter of a century, and
that happened twenty years ago.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Hall of the Company is situate in
Dowgate Hill, facing the west side of Cannon
Street Station, and having the Hall of the
Tallow-Chandlers’ Company adjoining it on the
north, and that of the Dyers’ Company on the
south. In and prior to the fourteenth century,
the buildings standing on the site were known
as the Copped Hall, but since the fourteenth
century the Copped Hall with certain shops
adjoining, or the buildings which have replaced
them from time to time, have formed the Hall
of the Skinners’ Company. The earliest deed
relating to the premises which is in the possession
of the Company is a grant of the
Copped Hall by Edmund, Earl of Cornwall,
to Reginald de Thunderley, in December, 1295.
The old Hall was consumed in the Great Fire
of 1666, after which the present Hall was
erected in its place.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the earliest members of the Company
to arrive at distinction was Thomas Legge, who
was Lord Mayor in 1347 and again in 1354,
and was the ancestor of the Earls of Dartmouth.
His was the age of the wars with France, and
he contributed £300 to the expenses of the
expeditionary forces. In 1364, the Skinners’
Company supplied a sum of £40 for the same
purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
order of precedence of the Companies was not
clearly defined, and struggles took place between
them from time to time, in which one Company
sought to establish its superiority over another.
The Skinners, who always ranked high among
the chief Companies, fell out with the Fishmongers
over this matter in 1339, and fighting
took place, which had to be put down by force.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the chief of these disputes in which the
Skinners were concerned took place at the
beginning of the reign of Richard III, between
the Skinners and the Merchant Taylors, which
again caused fighting, and led to the question
of precedence in processions between the two
Companies being submitted to the arbitration
of Lord Mayor Billesdon and the Aldermen of
the City of London, by whose award, dated
the 10th April, 1484—1 Ric. III—it was in
effect decided that each Company should invite
the Master and Wardens of the other to dine
with them in their Common Hall once a year,
and that the two Companies should take precedence
in processions in alternate years, beginning
at Easter. This order was only to be disturbed
by the event of a member of either Company
becoming Lord Mayor, in which case, according
to old custom, the Lord Mayor’s Company was
to take precedence of all others. The award
will be found in Appendix I, together with a
supplementary award of the 17th January, 1521—12
Hen. VIII—explaining that the original
award was applicable on all occasions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lord Mayor Billesdon’s award, which forms
the subject of the painting recently placed
by the two Companies jointly in the Royal
Exchange, has continued to be scrupulously
observed down to the present time. The two
Companies rank alternately sixth and seventh
among the twelve great Companies of the City,
and the Master and Wardens of each dine with
the other once a year; the Skinners’ entertainment
taking place in December, and that of
the Merchant Taylors’ in June. The representatives
of the visiting Company are received
as the chief guests of the occasion, and after
dinner the Master of the entertaining Company
gives the time-honoured toast, which, when the
entertainment is at Skinners’ Hall, is in the
following terms:—“The Master and Wardens
of the Worshipful Company of Skinners drink
health and prosperity to the Worshipful Company
of Merchant Taylors, also to the Worshipful
Company of Skinners, Merchant Taylors and
Skinners, Skinners and Merchant Taylors
root and branch; may they continue and flourish
for ever!” To which the Master of the Merchant
Taylors’ Company responds in identical form,
but transposing the names of the two Companies.
When the entertainment is at Merchant Taylors’
Hall, the Master of that Company gives the
toast on behalf of his Company, to which the
Master of the Skinners’ Company responds.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the year 1681, some little friction appears
to have occurred with respect to the annual
visit, as the Court Book for that year contains
the following entry under date August 9th:—“Whereas,
at a Court holden the 8th of June
last, it was ordered that the Mast<sup>r</sup> and
Wardens of the Merchant Taylors should be
invited to dine with this Worp<sup>l</sup> Comp: on their
Election Day, viz<sup>t</sup>, on the 15th of the said
month, and whereas the Mast<sup>r</sup> and Wardens of
the said Compa: were invited by the Wardens
of this Worp<sup>l</sup> Comp: at Merchant Taylors schoole
at the usuall time, and forasmuch as the Mast<sup>r</sup>
and Wardens of the said Company of Merchant
Taylors for severall reasons to their Court appearing
did decline the said invitac’on and sent
one of their Wardens to excuse their comeing;
and since, viz<sup>t</sup>, on Monday, the 8th of August
instant, one of their Wardens with some other
p’sons in his Comp: made an invitac’on to the
Mast<sup>r</sup> and Wardens of this Worp<sup>l</sup> Company to
dine with their said Company, on Thursday,
the 11th of this instant August. Now, this
Court haveing had informac’on from the Mast<sup>r</sup>
and Mr. Warden Key that such their invitac’on
was not made by ord<sup>r</sup> of Court of Assistants of
the said Company of Merchant Taylors, but
only by one of their Wardens, with the consent
and direction of the said Mast<sup>r</sup> and Wardens—This
Court doth therefore desire Mast<sup>r</sup> and
Wardens of this Company now p’sent to decline
goeing to their said Dinner or to accept thereof
in respect the said invitac’on was not made by
ord<sup>r</sup> of their Court according to their usuall
custome.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In pre-Reformation times, an important
feature in the conduct of the Company was the
performance of obits and rendering of honour
to departed members. The Renter Warden’s
accounts, which have been preserved from 1491
downwards, contain numerous references to such
matters. Thus, in 1535–6—</p>
<p class='c014'>“Pay’d to Syr John Stylbone, pryst, syngynge
and prayinge for the soule of
Master Merfen at the Charnel-house,
and at Seynt Antolyns, by yere</p>
<div class='c015'>vii<i>li.</i>”</div>
<p class='c014'>“Item, pay’d for the kepynge of Mr. Myrfyns
obbyte by yere at the Charnel-house      xxvi<i>s.</i> viii<i>d.</i>”</p>
<p class='c006'>Again, in the following year—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Payd for a dyner provided at Skynners’
Hall for the bequest of William Tornor,
Skynner, decessed, for the clothyn
of thys felysshipe in the tyme of thys
accompt</p>
<div class='c015'>iiii<i>li.</i> v<i>s.</i> ii<i>d.</i>”</div>
<p class='c014'>“Item, payd for spice, bred, wyne, and ale
at hys buryinge at Skynners’ Hall after
<i>Dirige</i> for the Company at the tyme of
his buryall in the tyme of thys accompt</p>
<div class='c015'> vi<i>s.</i> viii<i>d.</i>”</div>
<p class='c006'>On the other hand, we find among the receipts
in 1535–6—</p>
<p class='c016'>“R’d of Thomas Davy the yonger for a
fyne for that he denyed to bere the
corpus of Thomas Franke to hys beryall</p>
<div class='c015'>xii<i>d.</i>”</div>
<p class='c014'>“Item, r’d of Water Bucknell for a fyne for
that he gave oprobryus wordes to the
Master and Wardens, xx<i>d.</i>, and for that
he denyed to bere the corpus of Thomas
Franke, decessid, according to the ordynances</p>
<div class='c015'>iii<i>s.</i> iiii<i>d.</i> Summa v<i>s.</i>”</div>
<p class='c006'>So, in 1536–7—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Receyved of the executors of John Edwards,
Skynner, latte decessed, for
his bequest to make a recreacion at
Skynners’ Hall for the clothinge of
the Company that were present at his
buryall in the tyme of thys accompt</p>
<div class='c015'>xl<i>s.</i>”</div>

<p class='c010'>The fine imposed on Water Bucknell for his
“oprobryus” words to the Master and Wardens
show that the authorities of the Company knew
how to guard themselves from insult. But they
were equally careful in the case of less important
members. Thus, in 1535–6—</p>
<p class='c014'>“R’d of William Tornor for a fyne for that
he Revyled and myssayd ongoddly
wordes to George Forman</p>
<div class='c015'>v<i>s.</i>”</div>
<p class='c014'>“Item, R’d of George Forman for slaunderus
wordes and mysbehavyor to the
sayd William Turnor the same day</p>
<div class='c015'>iii<i>s.</i>”</div>
<p class='c006'>It may be conjectured that the 2<i>s.</i> by which
Turner’s fine exceeded Forman’s was owing to
the blasphemous character of his language.</p>

<p class='c010'>Litigation was a cheap and inexpensive amusement
in those days. Thus, in 1535–6—</p>
<p class='c014'>“Payd for the sute in the lawe bytwene
thys house and Mystres Bedell in the
Spirituall Corte for maynteynynge of
the Torches Master Bedyll gave thys
house</p>
<div class='c015'>vii<i>s.</i> vi<i>d.</i>”</div>
<p class='c006'>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the Company contained many men of distinction.
One of the more conspicuous of these
was Sir Andrew Judd, who was Master of the
Company in 1533, and on five subsequent
occasions. He was Alderman, Sheriff, and (in
1550) Lord Mayor of London. He was also
Mayor of the Staple of Calais, and in all his
various offices he was distinguished by loyalty
and capacity, taking, among other things, an
active part in the suppression of Sir Thomas
Wyatt’s rebellion. He died in 1558, having
amassed a considerable fortune as a merchant,
and was a benefactor of the Company to a
substantial extent. He founded the Company’s
almshouses for men in Great St. Helen’s. But
his especial glory is that, in the year 1553, he
founded and endowed, in his native town of
Tonbridge, under letters-patent obtained by
him from Edward VI, the famous free Grammar
School, now known as Tonbridge School, which
has since made good its claim to a place among
the great public schools of England. This
school is, by direction of the Founder, governed
by the Skinners’ Company, in whom he reposed
the fullest confidence, not unwisely.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very little now remains of the original school
buildings, with the exception of a part of the
Head-Master’s house; the old buildings were
removed and new ones erected in 1863–4, to
which were added a large block of science
rooms, with a library and gymnasium, in 1886–7,
and a great hall with another large block of
class-rooms and workshops, joining the science
buildings to the 1863–4 buildings, in 1894. A
new chapel was erected in 1900–2, replacing a
smaller one which had been built in 1859, but
which was never consecrated, and is now used
as a museum. Still further additional buildings
are in prospect. Large additions have also
been made to the playing-fields. The school
is now governed under a Scheme of the Charity
Commissioners of 1881, and contains about four
hundred boys.</p>

<p class='c010'>The annual Visitation of the Governors takes
place at the end of the summer term, when
the doors of the houses in the town are decorated
with young birch trees, in a way which
I only remember to have seen elsewhere at the
old Imperial city of Rothenburg, in Bavaria, at
Whitsuntide. On the first day the buildings
and property are inspected, and any necessary
directions given. On the second day a Latin
address, reminding one of the <i>Ad Portas</i> at
Winchester, is delivered by the Head Boy on
the arrival of the Governors at the School, to
which one of the Examiners replies. A roll-call
in the Great Hall follows, succeeded by a
commemorative service in the parish church,
at which an interesting bidding prayer is repeated
(see Appendix II). In the afternoon there is a
prize distribution in the Great Hall, with the
addition of addresses by the Head Master and
the Master of the Governors, an announcement
of the result of the examination for
leaving exhibitions, and a list of honours
obtained, which grows from year to year. Three
silver pens, respectively gilt, parcel-gilt, and plain,
are also presented to distinguished scholars, in
accordance with the Founder’s directions.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inscription on Sir Andrew Judd’s monument
in the church of St. Helen’s, Bishopsgate,
is as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Sir Andrew Judd’s daughter by his first wife
was named Alice, and married one Thomas
Smythe. She, by her will dated in 1592, left
considerable bequests for the benefit of the
inhabitants of the almshouses founded by her
father, and for other purposes connected with
the Company. Her second son was the well-known
Sir Thomas Smythe, referred to later on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Other conspicuous Skinners of the sixteenth
century were Sir John Champneys, Lord Mayor
in 1534 and six times Master of the Company;
Sir Richard Dobbs, Lord Mayor in 1551 and
four times Master, who took a very active part
in the foundation of Christ’s Hospital; Sir
Wolstan Dixie, Lord Mayor in 1585 and seven
times Master, also President of Christ’s Hospital;
Sir Stephen Slaney, Lord Mayor in 1595, Master
four times and President of Christ’s Hospital;
Sir Richard Saltonstall, Lord Mayor in 1597,
Master four times, and Governor of the Merchant
Venturers’ Company.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sixteenth-century benefactors of the
Company include Thomas Hunt and Lawrence
Atwell, under whose wills, dated respectively
in 1557 and 1588, considerable property was
bequeathed to the Company for various charitable
purposes; and Henry Fisher, under whose
benefaction, by deed dated in 1562, an Exhibition
at Brasenose College, Oxford, is maintained for a
Tonbridge scholar, and remuneration is provided
for the preacher of the annual Corpus Christi
sermon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir James Lancaster was a successful merchant,
trading to the East Indies, and an esteemed
naval commander. In 1600 he was
appointed the first Admiral of the fleet of the
East India Company, of which he was a director.
Under his will, dated 1618, certain Exhibitions
at the Universities, and stipends for poor
preachers, are awarded by the Company.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir Thomas Smythe, son of Dame Alice
Smythe, and grandson of Sir Andrew Judd,
after serving the office of Sheriff of London,
became the first Governor of the East India
Company. He was also prominent in connection
with the Muscovy Company and the
Virginia Company, and acted as Ambassador
from James I to the Czar of Russia. By his
will, proved in 1625, property was left to the
Company, out of which certain University Exhibitions,
as well as scholarships at Tonbridge,
are established; and the residue is distributed
for charitable purposes among poor residents in
certain parishes in Kent, under a scheme
sanctioned by the Chancery Division in 1883.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under the will of William Stoddard, dated
1611, the Company possesses the right to
nominate children to Christ’s Hospital.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the early years of the seventeenth century
the Company was largely occupied with the
acquisition and settlement of its Irish estates in
the County of Londonderry. Proposals for the
colonisation of large districts in the North of
Ireland were issued by the Crown in 1608, and
the response made by the public proving inadequate
for the purposes in view, application
was made to the City of London, which resulted
in the City undertaking the plantation of the
County of Londonderry. This was effected
through the instrumentality of a new Corporation
composed of Aldermen and members of the
Common Council, to which was given the name
of “The Irish Society.” Of this Society the
first Governor was Alderman Sir William Cokayne,
Lord Mayor in 1619, and Master of the
Company in 1609 and two later years. He was
also President of St. Thomas’ Hospital, and
was son of the donor of the Cokayne cups.
The first Deputy-Governor was also a Skinner,
William Towreson, or Towerson, who was
Master in 1616. The <i>modus operandi</i> was
that the county (exclusive of the towns of
Derry and Coleraine, and the ferries and fisheries)
was divided into twelve portions, equalised as
far as practicable, and that these were appropriated
by lot among the twelve great Companies.
With two exceptions, each of the twelve had
associated with it some of the minor Companies,
who contributed certain proportions of
the necessary funds, so that each of the twelve,
with its associated Companies, provided one-twelfth
of the total expense. The Skinners’
estate, constituting the Manor of Pellipar, was
shared by them with the Stationers, the White-Bakers,
and the Girdlers, the Skinners’ share
being somewhat larger than those of the other
three combined. In 1876, the Skinners’ Company
bought out the Stationers and Bakers,
leaving the Girdlers their sole co-owners, the
latter owning rather more than eleven per cent,
of the undivided estate, and the remainder
belonging to the Skinners’ Company. For
many years the estate was let to middlemen on
successive leases for three lives, but in 1872
this system came to an end, and the estate was
managed directly by the Skinners’ Company.
It has recently been disposed of under the
Irish Land Acts.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the seventeenth century, the Company
became possessed of a considerable estate in
Clerkenwell, known as “Clarke’s Close,” under
the will, dated in 1630, of John Meredith.
They also award another University Exhibition
under the will of Edward Lewis, dated in 1673.
Under the will of Lewis Newbury, dated in
1683, the Company’s almshouses for women
were erected at Mile End. These, as well as
the Judd almshouses for men at St. Helen’s,
have recently been replaced by new and more
commodious buildings at Palmer’s Green: to
which all inscriptions and other objects of
interest at the old almshouses have been carefully
removed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Company was involved in the troubles
arising from the arbitrary proceedings of the
kings of the Stuart family, and the disturbances
attending the establishment and supersession of
the Commonwealth. In 1625, the Company
was compelled by judgment, obtained on a writ
of <i>quo warranto</i>, to surrender its lands to the
Crown, but the judgment was set aside by the
Parliament in 1641, and Charles I assented to
their decision. During the great Civil War
large sums of money were advanced to the
City, and the Renter Warden’s accounts contain
numerous entries of expenditure on arms and
gunpowder. In 1645–6, the following entries
appear:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“Aug. 5. Paid the Collectors of Dowgate
Ward for 2 months ending 1 Aprill,

<p class='c010'>In 1648, the following entries relate to soldiers
quartered at the Hall:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“Nov. 30. Paid, spent on the Lieutenant
and souldiers when they came to
quarter in the Hall</p>
<div class='c015'>0000 13 06</div>

<p class='c012'>Paid for makeing cleane the Hall
after the souldiers were gone</p>
<div class='c015'>0000 12 04”</div>
<p class='c006'>It seems to have been considered imprudent
to make the entries too explicit in all cases.
Thus in 1642:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“Allowed to the Renter Warden for reasons
best known to the Auditors</p>
<div class='c015'>015 00 00”</div>

<p class='c010'>And in 1646–7 the same entry appears, but
the amount is increased to, 20–03–01.</p>

<p class='c010'>Many of the other entries during this period
are also worthy of note. Thus:—</p>
<p class='c019'>1644–5. “Paid for a drincking, July 18,
being a daye of Thankesgiving</p>
<div class='c015'>0002 16 01</div>

Maior and Aldermen att their going
to the funerall of the Protector</p>
<div class='c015'>0001 16 04”</div>

<p class='c010'>The Colonel Tichborne referred to in some
of the entries of 1648 was Sir Robert Tichborne
who gained an unfortunate prominence in the
times of the Commonwealth. After successful
trading he became a Colonel in the Parliamentary
army, and was appointed Lieutenant of
the Tower of London. He also obtained a seat
in Parliament, and in 1649 presented a petition
to the House of Commons in favour of the
execution of Charles I. He was a member of
the High Court by whom the King was condemned,
and signed the warrant for his execution,
in January, 1649. In 1650 he was Master
of the Company, and in the same year he served
as Sheriff of London, his colleague being another
Skinner, Richard (afterwards Sir Richard) Chiverton,
whose Mastership, in 1651, succeeded
his own. In 1655 he was knighted by the Lord
Protector, and in 1656 he filled the office of
Lord Mayor, in which he was again succeeded,
in 1657, by Chiverton. In 1657 he was nominated
one of Cromwell’s peers, and became
known as Lord Tichborne. A pageant was
provided by the Company on his accession to
the Civic Chair, at a cost of several hundreds of
pounds. As has been seen, the Company
availed themselves of his influence to secure
the removal of the soldiers who had been
quartered at the Hall in 1648, and they were not
ungrateful for his protection. The following
further entries in the Renter Warden’s accounts
refer to him:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“1650, Maye 30. Paid for a dinner when
our M’r. and Wardens went to the
Court of Aldermen about Alderman
Tichborne</p>

Courte of Assistance about Alderman
Tichborne</p>
<div class='c015'>0000 02 06”</div>

<p class='c010'>In the same year there appears among the
“good debts due to the house” the following:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“Alderman Tichborne, our M’r., for his
fyne to come into the Assistants</p>
<div class='c015'>0025 00 00”</div>
<p class='c020'>while in 1650–51 there appears among the
payments:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“Paid, allowed Alderman Tichborne out of
his fyne according to an order of Courte</p>
<div class='c015'>0025 00 00”</div>
<p class='c012'>1656–7. “Paid, given the Lord Maior by
order of Courte towardes the tryming
of his house</p>
<div class='c015'>0060 00 00”</div>
<p class='c006'>In 1653–4, under date February 8th, appears
the entry:—</p>
<p class='c021'>“Paid for a dynner when the Lord Protector
was feasted att Grocers’ Hall</p>
<div class='c015'>0026 04 02”</div>

<p class='c010'>After Cromwell’s death, when the Restoration
was approaching, “the Lord Tichborne” was
appointed one of a large committee to arrange
for a banquet to the Lord General Monk and
his lady, which took place on the 5th April,
1660. The following entry refers to this occasion:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“Paid for a dynner, April Vth, for the Lord
Generall Moncke, the Councell of
State, and the Feild Officers</p>
<div class='c015'>0476 12 09”</div>

<p class='c010'>In May following the Company provided
£504 towards a present from the City to the
King and the Dukes of York and Gloucester:
and various other sums were paid in connection
with the reception of Charles II, including “the
interteynement of his Ma<sup>tie</sup> to a Feast att Guildehall.”
The change of circumstances is further
attested by the following entries:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“1660–61. Paid the vergers att Poulis,
Januarye 30, being a daye of humiliation</p>
<div class='c015'>000 05 00</div>
<p class='c012'>Paid June 12, att the Myter Taverne, being
a daye of humiliation which turned
to a daye of rejoycing by meanes of
faire weather</p>
<div class='c015'>000 15 10”</div>

<p class='c010'>In the autumn of the year 1660 Tichborne
was tried as a regicide by the Special Commission,
and sentenced to death, but was not
executed. His property was, however, confiscated,
and he passed the remainder of his life
in confinement, and died a prisoner in the
Tower of London in 1682.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following entries in 1661–62 show that
the Company were not prevented by the heavy
taxes on their loyalty from giving effect to their
interest in learning:—</p>
<p class='c019'>“1661–2. Paid the royall present for the
Kinge’s Ma’tie according to an order
of Courte of the xxixth of August</p>
<div class='c015'>200 00 00</div>
<p class='c012'>Paid to the M’r and Fellows of Pembrooke
Hall in Cambridge towardes the
charge of their building according to
an order of Courte of the viiith of
Julye</p>
<div class='c015'>66 13 04”</div>

<p class='c010'>In 1665 came the Great Plague, followed, in
1666, by the Great Fire of London, in which
the old Skinners’ Hall shared the fate of so
many others of the City Halls. The Company’s
valuables were saved, but the Hall itself was
destroyed, and for some years after the meetings
of the Company were held in other halls and
buildings which had escaped the fire. Little
time was lost in rebuilding. Outstanding loans
were called in, land was sold, contributions were
levied upon members, and by 1672 the new
buildings were sufficiently completed for occupation
by Sir George Waterman, the Skinner
Lord Mayor of 1671–2, on whose accession to
office one of the numerous pageants provided
by the Company was represented. It was
usual at that period for the Hall to be let
to City functionaries for their term of office,
and the Court Books record a number of such
lettings. Mention may be made of such lettings
to Sir Robert Hanson, Lord Mayor, 1672–3,
and Sir Owen Buckingham, Sheriff, 1695–6.
From Christmas, 1698, to Michaelmas, 1707,
the East India Company had the use of the
Hall, and four silver candlesticks presented by
them are still in the possession of the Company.
In its leading features the Hall remains as it
then was, but various alterations and improvements
have been made from time to time. The
Great Dining Hall was improved in 1847–8, and
again in 1890–1, and is now in course of decoration
with historical paintings by Mr. Brangwyn,
A.R.A. The famous Cedar Drawing-room, commemorated
by Lord Macaulay, was fitted with a
new ceiling in 1876; the Oak Parlour was
restored in 1889, and a second entrance from
Cloak Lane has very recently been constructed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The more important pieces of plate in the
possession of the Company were presented in
the seventeenth century. The Cokayne cups,
already referred to, belong to the sixteenth
century, but with this important exception the
plate earlier than the nineteenth century all
dates from the seventeenth. Special mention
may be made of the Peacock Cup, representing
a silver peahen, with removable head, accompanied
by three peachicks, the gift of Mary,
widow of James Peacock, Master, 1638–9, presented
in 1642; the Master’s Salt, bequeathed
by Benjamin Albin, Master 1669–70, who had
taken an active part in rescuing the Company’s
plate at the time of the Great Fire: the Leopard
Snuff-box, presented by Roger Kemp, Master
1680, which is always placed in front of the
Master at banquets, school prize-givings, and
other functions; and the Monteith Bowls, purchased
with money bequeathed by Sir Richard
Chiverton, Master 1654, Lord Mayor 1657.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the Court of May 4th, 1681, “Major
Manley signifyed that the Right Hono<sup>ble</sup> the Earl
of Shaftesbury would doe the Company the
honour to take his ffreedome of this Socyety
w<sup>ch</sup> moc’on the Court agreed to and ordered
the Master and Wardens (and certain others
named), or as many of them as conveniently
can, to attend his Lordship, and to acquaint
him with their readiness to receive his Lordship
into their Society.” And on November 30th of
the same year, it was ordered that Lord Shaftesbury,
Lord Herbert, and Francis Charlton, Esq.,
should have their freedoms presented to them
in silver-gilt boxes, engraved with the Company’s
arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1684–5 the Company erected in the Royal
Exchange a statue of Edward III. A small
model of this statue was kept by the Company,
and on April 26th, 1738, “Mr. Deputy Nash
was desired to get the modell of King Edward
the III’ds statue repaired, and to get a handsome
frame and glass case to be set up above
the Master’s chair at the upper end of the
Hall.” This model is still preserved in the
Cedar Drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Company’s charters were seized on a
writ of <i>quo warranto</i> in the reign of Charles II,
and a fresh charter was granted by James II;
but the seizure and the new charter were set
aside by Act of Parliament, 2 Wm. and M.,
Sess. I, cap. 8, and the Company was restored
to its previous position.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sympathies of the Company at this crisis
in the national history are sufficiently evidenced
by an entry in the Court-Book for 1687, subscribed
by thirty-seven names: “Now whose
names are hereunder subscribed doe declare
that noe fforeigne prince, person, prelate, state,
or potentate hath or ought to have any jurisdiction,
power, superiority, pre-eminence, or
Authority Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall within this
Realme. Soe help me God.”</p>

<p class='c010'>During the struggle which led to the deposition
of James II, a very leading part was taken
by Sir Thomas Pilkington, Master in 1677 and
1681. He was elected M.P. for the City of
London in 1679, and again in 1680 and 1689.
He was Sheriff in 1681, and was very conspicuous
in his opposition to the Court party at
the election of his successor in the following
year. Before steps could be taken against him
for his conduct on this occasion, he had already,
in November, 1682, been sent to prison, where
he remained until June, 1686, for words spoken
in disparagement of the Duke of York. On
being tried, while a prisoner, for his behaviour
at the election of Sheriffs, he was again convicted
and fined, but this judgment was set
aside by the House of Lords in 1689. He
and others, including Roger Kemp, the donor
of the Leopard snuff-box, were removed from
the Court of the Company at the instance of the
Crown, but by Order in Council of September
25th, 1687, they were ordered to be re-admitted,
and those who had been substituted
for them to be displaced: which was carried out
by order of the Court on the 15th October,
1687. He had been Alderman of Farringdon
Without since 1680, but removed to Vintry in
1688; and on the death of Sir John Chapman,
the Lord Mayor, in March, 1689, he was elected
to succeed him for the remainder of the year.
Such was the esteem in which he was held, that he
was re-elected at the end of the year, and again
for a third year. On his becoming Lord Mayor,
the King and Queen were present at his
banquet, together with the Prince and Princess
of Denmark (afterwards Queen Anne), and most
of the dignitaries of the Kingdom and foreign
representatives. The Company provided a
pageant on his re-election in 1689; and so
enthusiastic were his colleagues in the Company
that, on his second re-election to the Mayoralty,
the Court, on November 25th, 1690, passed a
resolution which, after setting out various claims
which he had to their gratitude, proceeded as
follows:—“This Co<sup>t</sup> therefore, well weighing
the p’misses and calling to minde his Lo<sup>pps</sup>
sufferings by the excessive ffines and exorbitant
veredicts formerly given against him, meerly for
the faithfull discharge of his duty and trust
when Sheriffe of this Citty, and opposeing the
arbitrary and popish designs then carrying on
for the subversion and totall overthrow of the
Lawes and Established Religion of the Kingdom,
and that his Lo<sup>pp</sup> by his wise and prudent
government of this Citty for ye yeare last past
(being a yeare of extraordinary difficulty) hath
done great service to their Ma<sup>ties</sup>, the Nation, and
the Citty. This Co<sup>rt</sup> did and hereby doe unanimously
agree to pr’sent his Lo<sup>pp</sup> with the use of
the Hall for the yeare ensueing. And did alsoe
agree that the Master and Wardens and the
body of all the Assistants of the Worp<sup>ll</sup> Company
now p<sup>r</sup>sent should immediately attend
S<sup>r.</sup> Thomas Pilkington, Knight, the p<sup>r</sup>sent Lord
Maior, and acquaint his Lo<sup>pp</sup> with their Order
and acknowledgement, and likewise to returne
his Lo<sup>pp</sup> their hearty thankes for the good service
he hath done their Ma<sup>ties</sup>, the Nation, and
this Citty in his Lo<sup>pps</sup> last yeares prudent and
good Governm<sup>t</sup> thereof.” Lord Mayor Pilkington’s
picture, painted at this time by order of
the Court, still hangs in the Court-Room.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1689, the honorary freedom was presented
to the Earl of Monmouth (Master in
the following year), Sir Rowland Gwyn, the
Earl of Portland, and Lord Sydney; and on
Nov. 12th, 1689, it was “Ordered that the
Ma<sup>r</sup> and Wardens (and others) be desired as
a Comm’ee to joyne with the Right Honorable
the Lord Mayor and the other Honorary Members
of this Comp<sup>a</sup> to attend on their Mai<sup>ties</sup>
when the noble persons aforesaid shall appoint
to p<sup>r</sup>sent them with the copyes of their Freedomes,
each in a Box of Gold, of which the
Ma<sup>r</sup>, Wardens, and Comm<sup>ee</sup> aforesaid were
desired and ordered to provide the same.”
This was followed up by the following order
on Nov. 5th, 1690:—“Ordered that boxes of
gold to ye value of £60 p<sup>r</sup>sented to their
Ma<sup>ties</sup> with their ffreedomes, and that the R<sup>t</sup>
Hon<sup>ble</sup> the M<sup>r</sup> (the Earl of Monmouth) be
acquainted with it, and that the Wardens attend
his Lo<sup>pp</sup> touching the same and to follow his
Lo<sup>pps</sup> direc’con therein.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The time of the Court was not entirely
occupied with matters of state. On June 25th,
1689, the following entry occurs:—“M<sup>r</sup> Glover
(Thomas Glover, the executor of Lewis Newbury,
the founder of the almshouses at Mile End)
appeared and complayned of diverse great
disorders com’itted by severall of the Pen’coners
or Almesffellowes in the Almshouses at Mile
End of the erec’con of Mr. Lewis Newberry,
perticularly of the Wid: Barrett, her unruly sons
sometimes comeing in at unseasonable houres
and lodgeing there, and of an impudent girle of
ill Fame w<sup>ch</sup> Tho. Row employs there; likewise
of others selling ale on Sabbath daies after
sermon, namely Goodwife Dawson and Wid:
Carver. All which were respectively called in
and their sevrall misbehaviours rep<sup>r</sup>sented to
them and rebuked for it; but upon their promise
of amendm<sup>t</sup> for the future (and this being the
first compl<sup>t</sup> against them), the Court was
pleased to pardon their sevrall offences at
p<sup>r</sup>sent.” This warning seems to have been
only partially successful, for on Dec. 11th,
1696, the following further entry appears:—“This
Co<sup>r</sup>t being informed that the widow
Carver and the widow Goodwin, who inhabit
in the almeshouses at Mile End, did sell strong
water and ale, haveing been cautioned ag<sup>t</sup> the
same, yett nevertheless do still persist therein.
Itt was therefore ordered they should have notice
given them that unless they discontinue their
practice in a week’s time from the date hereof,
they shall bee removed from their almeshouses
and penc’ons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After the close of the seventeenth century,
the matters recorded are of less interest, and
the troubles of the Company were of a minor
order. Thus, in July, 1738, “Mr. Thomas
Zachary acquainted this Com<sup>ee</sup> that he had
casually dropt out of the Bag the little keys of
this Compa<sup>ys</sup> small iron chest wherein the Seal of
this Company was put, and also the Key of the
Poors Box, whereupon this Com<sup>ee</sup> sent for Mr.
Cooke, the Smith, and directed him to break
open the said small Chest and Poors Box, which
was done in their presence, and the Seal of this
Company and the other things therein contained
was taken out of the small iron chest, and also
twelve pounds fifteen shillings and six pence
out of the Poors Box, and were put into a bag
and sealed up by this Com<sup>ee</sup> and lockt up in this
Compa<sup>s</sup> large iron chest untill such time as the
Smith could mend the Locks and make new
keys to the said chest and Poors box, which
they ordered him forthwith to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Honorary Members elected in the
eighteenth century were:—in 1766, H.R.H. the
Duke of Cumberland; in 1767, the Rt. Hon.
C. Townshend, Chancellor of the Exchequer;
in 1794, Earl Howe, Admiral of England.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Honorary Members elected in the
nineteenth century were:—in 1834, Viscount
Strangford, a descendant of Sir Andrew Judd;
in 1861, Lord Clyde; in 1877, the late Earl of
Dartmouth, a descendant of Sir Thomas Legge;
in 1878, T. G. Kensit, Esq., Clerk of the Company,
1828–1878; in 1886, Sir Saul Samuel,
Agent-General for New South Wales (on the
occasion of the Colonial Exhibition); in 1893,
the present Earl of Dartmouth; in 1895, the
Rt. Hon. A. W. Peel, Speaker of the House
of Commons, afterwards Viscount Peel, and
the Most Rev. E. W. Benson, Archbishop of
Canterbury; in 1896, the Most Rev. W. Alexander,
Archbishop of Armagh, an old Tonbridge
scholar; in 1897, the Rt. Hon. W. C. Gully,
Speaker of the House of Commons, afterwards
Viscount Selby; in 1900, General the Rt. Hon.
Sir Redvers Buller.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since the commencement of the present
century the following have been elected:—in
1905, the Most Revd. R. Davidson, Archbishop
of Canterbury, and the Earl of Cromer;
in 1906, the Rt Hon. J. W. Lowther, Speaker
of the House of Commons, and Viscount
Milner.</p>

<p class='c010'>The later decade of the nineteenth century,
and especially the last twenty-five years, have
constituted a period of great activity and progress
on the part of the Company, especially in
the direction of education; and it has been a
matter of great satisfaction to the Company to
see the number of young persons, trained up
under their direction, increased from the two
hundred, or fewer, boys, educated at Tonbridge
School so late as the early ’eighties,
to approximately 1,100, distributed over four
schools, of which the second in point of date
was opened so recently as 1887. Out of the
1,100, nearly 400 are girls.</p>

<p class='c010'>These schools are, in addition to Tonbridge
School, of which the numbers now exceed four
hundred, the Commercial School at Tonbridge,
also on Sir Andrew Judd’s Foundation, opened
in 1888; the Company’s Middle School for
Boys at Tunbridge Wells, opened in 1887; and
the Company’s Middle School for Girls at
Stamford Hill, opened in 1890. Important
buildings have been erected at all these new
schools. The rebuilding and enlargement from
time to time of Tonbridge School have been
already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Company has also contributed very
large sums to the City and Guilds’ Institute
during the last twenty-five years, for the support
of its Central Technical College at South
Kensington, its Technical College at Finsbury,
its Art School at Kennington, and its Technological
Examinations. It also took an active
part in the foundation at Clerkenwell, on a site
adjoining the Company’s Clarke’s Close Estate,
of the Northampton Polytechnic Institute, to
which it contributes annually. It has also given
material assistance to the Leather Industries’
Department of the Yorkshire College, Leeds,
now the Leeds University. Members of the
Company take an active part in the government
of these various institutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1887, the Company took steps to obtain
the consolidation of their almshouses and of
their minor pension charities, and in 1891 a
Scheme, framed by the Charity Commissioners
at the suggestion of the Company, came into
operation, by which such charities were consolidated,
and in place of the Judd almshouses
in Great St. Helen’s, and the Newbury almshouses
at Mile End, new and more convenient
almshouses were erected at Palmer’s Green.
In connection with this Scheme, the various
charitable charges upon the Company’s properties
were redeemed, and the Company’s estates
are now free from any such charges.</p>

<p class='c010'>In furtherance of the policy of Parliament to
make the occupiers of land in Ireland the
owners of their holdings, the Company resolved
in 1886 to give their Irish tenants an opportunity
of purchasing their holdings under the
Land Acts; and the Pellipar Estate, in the
County of Londonderry, has now passed entirely
into the hands of the tenants.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Company’s Hall premises have been
greatly improved. Special mention may be
made of the decoration of the dining-hall,
which is now frequently placed at the disposal
of other Companies, and literary and scientific
institutions, on special occasions, and thus made
more frequently useful, and of the renovation
of the beautiful Oak Parlour, which had been
allowed to fall into disuse.</p>

<p class='c010'>In these various directions the present Court
of the Company claim to have shown themselves
not unworthy of the heritage handed
down to them by their predecessors.</p>

<p class='c022'><i>Bidding Prayer used at Tonbridge School at the
Annual Commemoration Service on Skinners’
Day at the end of the Summer Term.</i></p>
<hr class='c024' />
<p class='c010'><i><span class='small'>This prayer follows the anthem, the congregation all
standing.</span></i></p>

<p class='c010'>INASMUCH as, by the Providence of Almighty
God, from whom all good things do
come, on this day our School is gathered
together here, now as of old, to thank Him for
all His blessings, it is right that we should
remind ourselves once more of all that we owe
to those who have gone before us.</p>

<p class='c010'>And first you are to remember your Founder,
Sir Andrew Judd, Knight.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was born at Tonbridge on the estate of
his ancestors called “Barden,” situated by the
river side below Quarry Hill. He was apprenticed
in London into the Company of Skinners,
and became himself a Skinner and a Merchant
of Muscovy. He went with the ships of the
Merchants’ Company, which rounded the North
Cape to the coast of Russia. He crossed the
country in sledges a seven days’ journey to the
River Volga, and so to Astrakan on the Caspian
Sea. He also went to the West Coast of Africa,
to Guinea, at the request of King Edward VI,
and brought thence gold dust to be coined into
guineas, and many natural curiosities. In the
year 1544 he was Sheriff of London, and in the
year 1550–1 he was Lord Mayor, in which office
he bore himself with loyalty and with valour.
On six several occasions he was Master of the
Skinners’ Company—in the years 1533, 1538,
1542, 1547, 1551, and 1555. In 1554 he was
called upon to make stand for Queen Mary
against the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt. He
was, moreover, Mayor of the Staple of Calais,
and held many public offices of trust, under
both Edward and Mary, so that he is rightly
accounted one of “the Worthies of England.”
He died in 1558, and is buried in the Church
of St. Helen’s, in Bishopsgate, in London, where
stands a monument to his memory in marble.</p>

<p class='c010'>Five years or more before he died he founded,
not by will, but at his own expense during
his lifetime, besides his almshouses near to
St. Helen’s Church, “a stately Free School” at
Tonbridge. This he diligently fostered, and
framed for it Statutes under which it was
governed for 327 years: Statutes full of kindly
wisdom. Further, he endowed it with certain
houses in Gracechurch Street, and with the
estate of the Sandhills in the parish of St.
Pancras, and afterwards by will in 1558 with
other gifts, whence the School is to this day
supported and increased. For all these good
deeds, and because this School hath for its
Founder so manly and so worthy a gentleman,
you shall thank God.</p>

<p class='c010'>And, secondly, you are to remember the
grandson of your Founder, the son of his
daughter Alice, Sir Thomas Smythe, a great
benefactor to the School and to the poor of
Tonbridge. He was born about 1558, and
dwelt near Southborough. He was for fifteen
years Governor of the East India Company, and
took part in establishing the Colony of Virginia.
He founded four Exhibitions from this School
to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
He died in 1625, and was buried at Sutton-at-Hone,
in Kent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Furthermore, you are to remember Henry
Fisher, the faithful servant of Sir Andrew Judd,
who founded a Scholarship at Brasenose College,
Oxford; Sir Thomas White, founder of
St. John’s College, Oxford, who, “<i>propter
eximium amorem in Andream Judd</i>,” gave to
Tonbridge School a Fellowship, now a close
Scholarship, at his College, also <i>Robert Holmdon</i>,
the founder of the Leathersellers’ Exhibitions,
<i>Thomas Lampard</i>, <i>Lady Mary Boswell</i>, <i>Mr.
Worrall</i>, <i>Mr. Strong</i>, all of them Benefactors
of the School, and many others whose names
are not recorded.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nor shall you forget all those who, as Governors,
or as Masters, or as Boys, or in whatever
station in this School, during more than
350 years have striven with faithful hearts to
serve it; their noble deeds and character are
ours by inheritance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally, let us pray, that, when our time shall
come to fall asleep, we, too, after their example
may have faithfully served our generation by the
will of God: To whom be all honour and
glory, world without end. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><i>Let us Pray.</i></div>

<p class='c025'>[<i>The two following prayers were written in Latin for
the use of Tonbridge School very shortly after its foundation
in 1553</i>, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>]</p>

<p class='c010'>ÆTERNE Deus, a quo solo omne bonum
consilium, omnis bona cogitatio procedit, gratias
tibi maximas agimus, quod viris optimis, et
Andreae Judd, militi, Scholam hanc pie instituendi,

Ecclesiae regnoque tuo utilem semper facias; et
ut nos cum omni diligentiâ eo contendamus quo
pii illi nos pervenire voluerunt, ut bene pieque

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
